# SeamCarving

Implemented a project to incorporate seam carving, a content-aware image resizing technique, with functionality similar to Adobe Photoshop. The project focused on reducing the image size incrementally by minimizing the sum of the dual-gradient energy along a path of pixels. The aim was to preserve crucial image features while resizing.
